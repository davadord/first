% To compile issue the following commands:
% latex mitsample
% bibtex mitsample
% latex mitsample

% latex mitsample

% To view use xdvi (on unix systems):
% xdvi mitsample.dvi

%
% To view the postscript file, use ghostview or gv (on unix systems):

%************************************************
% Optional packages.
%
% The use of these packages is optional: they are standard now and
% should be installed on your system, but if they are not, you might
% have to comment out the appropriate lines to get this file to
% compile.
%
%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

%******** graphics and graphicx ******************************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
\DeclareGraphicsRule{.emf}{bmp}{}{}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.png,.jpg} %solo para PDFLaTeX

%******** lscape ******************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment. Note that this output might only be valid
% after converting to a postscript or pdf file.
\usepackage{lscape}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% Also, the hyperref package should be loaded last as it modified the
% commands in many other pagckages.
\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{url}
% If you would like to compile this sample thesis without the
% hyperref package, then you will need to comment out the previous
% \usepackage command and uncomment the following command which will
% put the URL's in a typewriter font but not link them.
%\newcommand\href[2]{\texttt{#2}}
%\renewcommand*\familydefault{\sfdefault}
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{phv} % Arial
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{phv} % Arial
